# SalaryPrediction
The purpose of this project is to help those aspiring to join the data science field easily understand what it takes to turn a model into an API.
This implies that they will learn how to create a python code to read in the target dateset and pass the values to a model (Linear regression model) and test.
Eventually, the model is converted to an API that can then be called via an app or postman.
